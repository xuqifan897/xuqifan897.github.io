# Who am I
I'm a PhD student of UCLA in biomedical physics supervised by Dr [Ke Sheng]. I'll move with our group to UC Berkeley/UCSF. My research interest lies in the application of optimization, high-performance computing, machine learning, and Monte Carlo methods in biomedical research and beyond. I obtained my B.S. in applied physics in University and Science and Technology of China in 2020. I was a visiting student in UCLA at my current lab though CSST program. Prior to starting my PhD, I was a visiting student of [HPC-AI Lab] in collaboration with Dr Yang You, during which we conducted research in the application of distributed matrix-matrix multiplication algorithms to the parallelization of large language models.

I shamelessly declare that I have a strong background in mathematics, physics, and programming. I'm a active and fast learner. I'm interested in a lot of topics. As a result, I know a little about everyting.

# Skills
* General: Linux, Windows, Git, ssh
* Programming: C++ (CMake, CUDA), Python (PyTorch), MATLAB
* Documentation: Word, LaTeX, markdown

# Projects
## Direct beam angle optimization with simulated annealing based on GPU dose calculation (on going)

External beam radiation therapy planning aims to maximize the dose to tumor while sparing normal tissues. In this work, we
* Utilize the massive parallelism of GPU to achieve on-the-fly dose calculation
* Apply simulated annealing to optimize the beam angles, while updating the fluence map using gradient descent
* Achieved lower loss compared with previous methods, which potentially leads to better treatment quality.
